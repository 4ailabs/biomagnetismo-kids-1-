The baby absorbs all maternal vibrations with total permeability, while their tissues record significant events creating cellular memory.

      "intro": "In the context of pediatric biomagnetism, it is fundamental to understand the belonging laws that govern the family system and how these manifest in the child's energetic field. These laws determine the family energetic dynamics and patterns that can manifest as specific symptoms.",
